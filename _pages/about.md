Hello! I'm Xiaoshan Lin, a PhD student majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 

My research interests lie in 1) motion planning with energy-constrained heterogeneous multi-robot systems for 
environmental monitoring; and 2) reinforcement learning with temporal logic specifications with a probabilistic 
satisfaction guarantee.

In my spare time, I like cooking, hiking and playing with my cat.
