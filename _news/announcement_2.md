ðŸŒŸ **Wrapping Up an Amazing Internship at <a href="https://www.merl.com/">Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) </a>!** ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my internship at **MERL** as a **research intern**. During this journey, I:

* **Conducted** experimental validation for environmental monitoring with energy-constrained UAVs and mobile charging stations.
* **Developed** a linear-assignment-based algorithm for collision avoidance.

A big thank to **Dr. Abraham Vinod** and the incredible team for their mentorship and support. Iâ€™m thrilled to share 
that my work during this internship will result in a paper that we plan to submit to a journal. Stay tuned for more updates!

Looking forward to applying what I've learned as I continue my PhD research at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities!
